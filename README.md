### DigitalCraft's Full Stack Project
This project was created during DigitalCraft's 16-week bootcamp by Amanda Hargrove and Olivia Campbell. 

Benji-Knows is a pet tracking app which allows a user to create profiles for their pets and then track various activities such as giving medication. 

To run this program, you'll just need to visit https://benji-codes.herokuapp.com/ and either create an account to start logging your pets or click "Continue as Guest" to view a pre-created account. 

If you'd like to run this program on a local server and database - you'll need to clone our repository, open it in a code editor, run the command "npm i" to download all of the dependences for this program and then create a .env file to connect a database.
